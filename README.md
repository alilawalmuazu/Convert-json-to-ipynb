To convert a JSON file to an IPython Notebook (.ipynb) file in Python, you can use the following code. This code assumes that you have the nbformat library installed, which is commonly used to work with Jupyter Notebook files programmatically.
Make sure to replace 'input.json' with the path to your JSON file and 'output.ipynb' with the desired path where you want to save the resulting IPython Notebook file.

This code reads the JSON file, iterates over its cells, creates a new IPython Notebook, adds code cells to the notebook, and then writes the notebook to a .ipynb file.
